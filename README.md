# PokemonCardGeneratorProject1

## Description

This application "PokemonCardGeneratorProject1" generates any Pokemon the user searches up in the search "pokemon" bar. It generates a card that shows up a giphy picture related to a certain Pokemon. Under the picture, it displays facts about the Pokemon. Like name, id #, attacks, and abilities.

## Installation

The steps that were required to install my project are creating an index.html, css.style, and script.js. I used APIs from https://pokeapi.co and https://developers.giphy.com.
